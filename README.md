# I'm Guillaume Mariette

I have skills in 3D modeling and UI design. I studied at ETPA school in Rennes, France, where I acquired my 3D and UI skills. Before that, I spent my high school years in a graphic design class, where I learned the adobe combination. I also have video editing skills, which I learned by myself or with tutorials on youtube.
